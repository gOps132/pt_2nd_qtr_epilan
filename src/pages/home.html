    <h1>This is the home page</h1>
    <p>I am really not sure what to put here</p>
    <p>
        This site contains some personal information and some other cool stuff  <br>
        I actually did implement some sort of framework for templating and routing although <br>
        most of it is implemented manually                                                   <br>
        I did learn a lot of stuff in webpack and other web technologies :)
